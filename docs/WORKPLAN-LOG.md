# Work log — local (real-AE) session

Append-only. Every unattended pass (`scripts/run-local-agent.ps1`) starts
a FRESH session with no memory of the last one, so this file is the only
thing carrying progress forward. Read it before picking work; write to it
before you stop.

One entry per pass, newest at the bottom:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <workplan item>
- Changed: <files + what, one or two lines>
- Harness: <passed>/<total>  (or: could not run, why)
- Notes: <assumptions made, anything blocked, anything a human must look at>
```

Keep entries short. If something needs the remote session (a release, a
ComfyUI decision, an architecture call), say so under Notes rather than
building it here.

## 2026-08-20 — baseline

Nothing done yet. The first overnight attempt did zero passes: the local
clone predated `docs/WORKPLAN.md`, and a turn-based session has no loop —
it ran the harness once and idled. `scripts/run-local-agent.ps1` is the
fix. Start from item 1 of `docs/WORKPLAN.md`.

## 2026-08-20 09:41 — items 1 and 2 (first bullet)

- Changed: `scripts/ae-selftest.jsx` — `var final` was an ES3
  FutureReservedWord, so AE rejected the WHOLE file at compile time and
  the harness had never once run from the CLI. Added
  `tests/test-es3-syntax.js` (scans, does not execute — Node cannot
  catch this by running the code) covering every ExtendScript-compiled
  file. Added two steps to `extension/js/selftest.js` proving the grid
  rig EVALUATES, plus an args-aware stub in `tests/test-self-test.js`.
- Harness: 26/26 (was 24). Green under BOTH expression engines,
  `javascript-1.0` and legacy `extendscript`. Stubbed suite 11/11.
- Notes: the exit-3 message points at the "Allow Scripts to Write
  Files" preference — that is a RED HERRING. A compile error in the
  runner produces the same exit 3, because the try/catch that writes
  the results file never runs either. Worse, the resulting modal
  DISABLES AE's main window, so every later `AfterFX.exe -r` is
  silently swallowed while AE still looks healthy and responsive. If a
  pass ever sees exit 3, check for a `#32770` dialog on the AfterFX
  process before believing the preference story.
  Also verified (not just assumed) that bad expressions really are
  rejected under both engines — a bogus layer reference and the 2D
  `value[2]` trap — so the expression greens are not false passes.
  Left for the remote session: `run-ae-selftest.ps1` should surface a
  blocking dialog's text instead of its generic timeout, and
  `writeOut()` in the runner should not depend on `AELLJSON`, so a load
  failure can still report itself. Project expression engine was
  flipped during testing and restored to `javascript-1.0`.
  Next up in item 2: `center_anchor_point` on rotated/scaled/parented
  layers, then `scale_comp` with cameras and keyframed properties —
  the two most likely to be hiding a real bug behind stub-only proof.

## 2026-08-20 (remote) — the two follow-ups logged above

- Changed: `scripts/ae-selftest.jsx` — `writeOut()` no longer depends on
  `AELLJSON`; it serializes with a self-contained escaper, so a failure
  to load hostscript.jsx can now report itself instead of throwing
  inside the catch block meant to report it. Error text also carries
  `err.line` when AE provides it. `scripts/run-ae-selftest.ps1` — new
  exit code 4: polls for a `#32770` dialog owned by AfterFX during the
  wait and prints its caption plus child text, instead of timing out
  after 240s and blaming the scripting preference. The generated
  wrapper also try/catches `$.evalFile` and writes what it caught.
- Harness: NOT run from here (no AE, no PowerShell in the remote
  environment). Stubbed suite 11/11, both scripts verified pure ASCII.
- Notes: the dialog probe is the reliable path; the wrapper's try/catch
  is best-effort because a COMPILE error may surface as a modal rather
  than a catchable exception — unverified either way, so the probe does
  not depend on it. First real exercise of exit 4 happens on the AE
  machine. To test it deliberately: put `var final = 1;` in
  `scripts/ae-selftest.jsx`, run the harness, expect exit 4 with the
  dialog text rather than a 4-minute timeout.

## 2026-08-20 (remote) — harden the dialog probe

- Changed: `scripts/run-ae-selftest.ps1`. Three faults in the probe I
  shipped an hour ago, all found by asking what a green run actually
  exercises. (1) `Add-Type` and `FindDialog` failures were swallowed
  into `''`, making a BROKEN probe indistinguishable from "no dialog" —
  the same silent-degradation shape as the bug this all started with.
  Both now print a WARNING. (2) The probe keyed off window class
  `#32770`; AE also raises its own DroverLord-classed windows, which it
  would have missed. It now treats a DISABLED main window as the
  authoritative modal signal and uses class only to gather text.
  (3) `Add-Type` is guarded against re-entry via `PSTypeName`.
- Harness: NOT run from here. Stubbed suite 11/11, file pure ASCII.
- Notes: a green 26/26 run DOES execute `Get-BlockingDialog` at least
  once (the wait loop calls it before re-testing for results), so it
  proves the probe compiles and returns empty without throwing. It does
  NOT exercise the enumeration, the child-text walk, or exit 4 — that
  needs a real modal. Deliberate test: put `var final = 1;` in
  `scripts/ae-selftest.jsx`, run the harness, expect exit 4 naming the
  dialog within seconds instead of a 240s timeout, then revert.

## 2026-08-20 (remote) — center_anchor_point: real bug + the stub that hid it

- Changed: `extension/jsx/hostscript.jsx` `center_anchor_point`, and new
  `tests/test-anchor-point.js` (18 assertions). Also made
  `tests/test-curve-tools.js`'s `Prop.setValue` throw on keyframed
  properties, matching AE.
- Harness: NOT run from here. Stubbed suite 12/12.
- Notes: the tool wrote Position with `setValue()`, which real AE REFUSES
  on a keyframed property — so it failed on any animated layer, the
  normal case for this panel. It now offsets EVERY Position key by the
  compensation delta. An animated Anchor Point now returns a grounded
  error (there is no single value to centre) instead of AE's raw throw,
  and an expression-driven Position gets a WARNING in the note because
  the write is accepted but never visible.
  It had ZERO stubbed coverage — that is why it survived. The new stub
  models two things the older ones did not: `setValue` throws when
  `numKeys > 0`, and 2D Position/Anchor are PADDED to 3 components (the
  older stub padded only Scale, so `value.length > 2` was false there
  and true in AE — the exact infidelity behind the original grid bug).
  Parenting needs no special case: Position is already in the parent's
  space and the delta is carried there by the layer's own scale and
  rotation. That is reasoned, not observed — worth confirming.
- FOR THE LOCAL SESSION (item 2, next): verify in real AE, then promote
  to `selftest.js`. Build a layer with Position keys, rotate it, scale
  it, parent it to a null, run `center_anchor_point`, and confirm the
  layer does not visually jump at ANY key time (not just the current
  one). Then the same on a 3D layer and on a text layer, where
  `sourceRectAtTime` moves with the content.
