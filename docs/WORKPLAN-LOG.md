# Work log — local (real-AE) session

Append-only. Every unattended pass (`scripts/run-local-agent.ps1`) starts
a FRESH session with no memory of the last one, so this file is the only
thing carrying progress forward. Read it before picking work; write to it
before you stop.

One entry per pass, newest at the bottom:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <workplan item>
- Changed: <files + what, one or two lines>
- Harness: <passed>/<total>  (or: could not run, why)
- Notes: <assumptions made, anything blocked, anything a human must look at>
```

Keep entries short. If something needs the remote session (a release, a
ComfyUI decision, an architecture call), say so under Notes rather than
building it here.

## 2026-08-20 — baseline

Nothing done yet. The first overnight attempt did zero passes: the local
clone predated `docs/WORKPLAN.md`, and a turn-based session has no loop —
it ran the harness once and idled. `scripts/run-local-agent.ps1` is the
fix. Start from item 1 of `docs/WORKPLAN.md`.
